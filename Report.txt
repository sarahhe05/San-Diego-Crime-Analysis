A report of steps taken and reasoning 

We downloaded the dataset from https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/police-nibrs/.

*Data Cleaning*

We removed columns that didn't have relevant information. The columns we kept are:
'case_number': San Diego Police Department Case Number used for tracking purposes within the SDPD's records management system.
'occured_on': 
'pd_offense_category':
'neighborhood':
'division':
'city': the city the crime occurred in
'latitude':
'longitude'


We removed rows with "All Other Offenses" for its offense category ?? from consideration that didn't have crimes with clear labels 


*Exploratory Data Analysis*

We looked at neighborhoods with most crime 

We looked at times of day where the most crime happened
